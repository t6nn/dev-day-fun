## Input
Provided from standard input via `System.in`. List of positive integers separated by spaces.
Example:

    1 2 2 1 3 1 1 2 2 4 3 4 3

## Task
You are given an array of positive integers, each number repeats even number of times (2k) except for one. Find the number that repeats an odd number (2k+1) of times.

## Output
The integer repeating odd number of times, sent to standard output via `System.out`. No other characters expected.
Example (for the array above):
    
    3

## Code Golf
Solutions compete against each other, based on the number of bytes in your source file. The solution
*must* be correct. The player with the least total number of bytes over all assignments wins.
