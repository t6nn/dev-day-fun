# Code golf - Finding the sum of matrix cells

## Input
A string representing a matrix (a two dimensional array) of integers. Elements are separated by commas while rows of the matrix are separated by symbol '$'.

## Task
Given a matrix, find the number of its elements.
Example:

    1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1$
    1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1$
    0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1000

In this example the sum of the cells would be 1008.
 
## Output
Number representing the sum of the elements modulus 13092017;
